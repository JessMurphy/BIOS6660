The R interpreter determines the value of a variable when executing a function by using lexical scoping. 
It first looks for the variable in the function's temperory environment within the body of the function. 
Variable names inside the function mask any variables with the same name defined outside of the function. 
If the name doesn't exist inside the function, the interpreter looks for it one level up. 
This may be the global environment or another function if the function was called within a function.
