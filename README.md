This repository contains the homework assignments for my Analysis of Genomic Data using R and Bioconductor (BIOS 6660) course taken at the University of Colorado Anschutz campus in Spring 2019.
The content of the homework assignments are as follows.

Homework 1: introduction to the command line and git/github; create and navigate directories; create an empty text file

Homework 2: create an R script; edit a file on github; use git commit, git push, and git pull

Homework 3: use RMarkdown to generate a report; use dplyr and ggplot2 to analyze and visualize a large dataset

Homework 4: create a README file; use .gitignore; use RStudio projects; test and debug; create and run a bash script 

Homework 5: develop an end-to-end reproducible data analysis using a public dataset

Homework 6: pre-process paired-end RNA-Seq data into a dataset ready to be analyzed (trim, check for quality, align to the genome, and quantitate)

Homework 7: perform differential expression analysis on RNA-Seq data using a GLM negative binomial model

Homework 8: analyze ChIP-Seq data (define and annotate peaks, perform enrichment analysis)

Homework 9: access publicly available data using GEOsearch, GEOquery, and TCGAbiolinks in R

Homework 10: pre-process DNA methylation data (remove bad probes and samples, check bead count and non-CG probes, map to genome)

Homework 11: analyze cleaned DNA methylation data (perform normalization, batch correction, cell type deconvolution, and DMP and DMR analysis) 

Homework 12: analyze genetic associaton study data (estimate minor allele frequencies, find set of common SNPs, calculate difference in allele frequencies between populations)
